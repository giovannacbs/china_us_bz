    <p>With an economy increasingly integrated into global trade, Brazil’s commercial balance is heavily influenced by two economic giants: China and the United States. <br> <br> Both countries stand as Brazil’s largest trading partners, moving billions in exports and imports that drive key sectors of the Brazilian economy. <br> <br> China, as the top destination for commodity exports, and the United States, with a strong presence in the market for manufactured goods, form a strategic commercial relationship that enhances Brazil's global significance. This positioning places Brazil within a web of economic interdependencies, underscoring its role in the broader global trade network.</p>
